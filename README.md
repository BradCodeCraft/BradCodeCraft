# 👋 Hi, I’m @BradCodeCraft
📚 I am an Indiana University Undergraduate majoring in Information Systems with a minor in Computer Science.

👀 I’m interested in astronomy, soccer, and sci-fi movies/series.

🌱 In my free time, I like to read and listen to Christian content and learn more about programming, e.g., languages, frameworks, etc.

💞️ I’m looking to improve my technical skills as a junior software engineer
